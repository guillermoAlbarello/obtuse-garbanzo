## Description
In this repository you will find a solution with some of the tools we use on daily basis.
bellow a list for your reference

* [Nancyfx](https://github.com/nancyFx/Nancy).
* [Nunit](http://www.nunit.org/).
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

in this case we are using a simple json file to store data, it will be enough for this excersise, but feel free to replace it with any tool you feel used to work with.

## Tasks

###Create all tests cases you think will matter in order to cover below requirements:

1. Create a new inventory Item
2. Archive an inventory Item
3. Add stock to the inventory item
4. Remove stock from the inventory

Use any automation tool you see fit to the task, as you can see on code some unit tests are already there, please eval the effectiveness of each of them and if needed change add or delete.

##Workflow

1. Please [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository under your github account.
2. [Clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) it on your machine.
3. To work on it you can use any of these tools:

	* [Visual Studio 2013 and above] (https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs.aspx)
